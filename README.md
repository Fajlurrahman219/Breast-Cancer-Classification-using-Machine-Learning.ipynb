# Breast-Cancer-Classification-using-Machine-Learning.ipynb

🧠 Step 1: What You’ve Done So Far

You have:

Imported key ML libraries: NumPy, Pandas, sklearn.

Loaded the Breast Cancer Dataset from sklearn.datasets.

Explored its:

Shape → (569, 31) → 569 samples, 30 features + 1 label.

Missing values → None ✅

Statistical summary → Checked with .describe().

Added the target column (0 = malignant, 1 = benign).

Verified dataset cleanliness.

This means your dataset is now ready for model training.

🚀 Step 2: Next Steps (Model Training)

Let’s continue your project.
You’ll now:

Split data into training and testing sets.

Train a Logistic Regression model.

Evaluate its accuracy.

Here’s the continuation code 👇

# Step 1: Separate features and target
X = data_frame.drop(columns='label', axis=1)
Y = data_frame['label']

# Step 2: Split the data
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, stratify=Y, random_state=2)

# Step 3: Train the model
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=10000)
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# Step 4: Evaluate model accuracy
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# On training data
X_train_pred = model.predict(X_train)
train_acc = accuracy_score(Y_train, X_train_pred)

# On test data
X_test_pred = model.predict(X_test)
test_acc = accuracy_score(Y_test, X_test_pred)

print("✅ Training Accuracy:", train_acc)
print("✅ Testing Accuracy:", test_acc)

🩺 Step 3: Predicting New Data (Example)

You can also test your model on new patient data.

# Example input data (random values from dataset)
input_data = (17.99, 10.38, 122.80, 1001.0, 0.11840, 0.27760, 0.3001,
              0.14710, 0.2419, 0.07871, 1.095, 0.9053, 8.589, 153.4,
              0.006399, 0.04904, 0.05373, 0.01587, 0.03003, 0.006193,
              25.38, 17.33, 184.60, 2019.0, 0.1622, 0.6656, 0.7119,
              0.2654, 0.4601, 0.11890)

# Change to numpy array
input_data_np = np.asarray(input_data).reshape(1, -1)

# Predict
prediction = model.predict(input_data_np)

if prediction[0] == 0:
    print("🚨 The tumor is *Malignant* (Cancerous)")
else:
    print("✅ The tumor is *Benign* (Non-cancerous)")
    

❤️ Step 4: Helping a Real Patient (Your Question)

If a person is already diagnosed with breast cancer, ML can help in supportive ways, such as:

ML Use Case	Purpose
🧬 Treatment Recommendation Systems	Suggests best treatment options using past medical data.
🩻 Tumor Progression Prediction	Predicts how quickly cancer may spread (stage progression).
🧫 Drug Response Prediction	Helps find which chemotherapy or medicine may be most effective.
📊 Survival Analysis Models	Predicts survival rate and helps doctors plan treatments.
📱 AI Health Apps	Tracks recovery and side effects after treatment.
